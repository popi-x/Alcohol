If you see the following error during build, check this.

ArgumentException: The Assembly UnityEditor is referenced by Easy FBX Anim Modifier ('Assets/DoubleL/EasyFBXAnimationsSettings/Easy FBX Anim Modifier.dll'). But the dll is not allowed to be included or could not be found.

1. Go to the EasyFBXAnimationsSettings folder.
2. Select the Easy FBX Anim Modifier file.
3. Check the Inspector window.
4. In the Select platforms for plugin setting,
5. Uncheck Any Platform if it is checked.
6. In the Exclude Platforms setting,
7. Check Editor.

If you set it this way, the error will disappear during build.
